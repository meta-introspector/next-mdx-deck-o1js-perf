## Goals & Objectives

- Add performance recording tools.
- Enable function-level profiling.
- Optimize Mina O1JS-based applications.

<SpeakerNotes>

These goals are designed to enhance developer experience and efficiency when building on the Mina protocol. The objective is to ensure function-level visibility in application performance.

## Current Progress

- **Development Phase**: Initial scoping and design completed.
- **Tooling**: Proof-of-concept for function profiling developed using github actions and hugging face
- **Community Collaboration**: Early feedback integrated.

## Planned Next Steps

* Complete integration of profiling tools by the end of October.

  We rewrote the profiling tools to be minimal and not use clinic or docker because of simplicity.

* Flexible Publishing of reports to github pages and hugging face spaces

We are pulling the data directly from github actions and hosting the frontend ourselves for maximum control.

* Integration of performance recording and reporting into zkapp nextjs front end
this is alreadly possible with kiwi brower if we have the latest version of react installed.

  We can profile the latest reporting tool we worked on.

* Creation of deno js frontend
We started on 

* Creating better type system

Create callback interface

Aggregation of reports and creating of notebooks with proofs

Expand testing and collect community feedback.

Finalize documentation for developers.

Plan a feedback session after beta testing.
